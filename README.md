# EE559-Project_Hand-Posture
In this project, I try to deal with the hand postures data set from UCI, specifically, it has 12 volunteers to show their hand postures and we set these postures from posture 1 to posture 5 as class 1 to class 5. From this information, I try to know if these postures can be figured out by our machine. And if the different posture will show the same similar accuracy in each classification. To figure out, I first preprocess the data by removing the unlabeled data, then feature extract the data as 13 features, rescaling, dimensionality adjustment (using PCA), use cross-validation (leave-one-user-out). I choose perceptron, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, KNN, and neural network(MLP) as my classifiers, and compare to all of these, I get the best performance from polynomial SVM with C:0.10404983103657856 and its test score is 0.921312753105729.
